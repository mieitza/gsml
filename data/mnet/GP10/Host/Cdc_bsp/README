This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MPC821/860ADS
and MPC8xxFADS target boards.  Specifically, this file contains information
on any BSP interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry (i.e., man ads860)
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 1.1/3  Apr 98, re-release
	Added support for the MPC8xxFADS mother/daughter boards.  Uses SCC2
	for 823/850 daughterboards.

RELEASE 1.1/2  Jan 97, Tornado 1.0.1 re-release
	Added a macro DEFAULT_POWER_MGT_MODE to select the default
	power mode.  Turned off cache when EDO dram is selected.

RELEASE 1.1/1  FCS, Nov 1996,  (ADS860_1_1_1)
	
	This release is the first FCS release of the ads860 BSP against
	Tornado 1.0 PPC (FCS). The same BSP is used by the PowerPC 821
	and PowerPC 860.

	The default BSP configuration is for a MPC821/860ADS REV A
	board with either a MPC821 REV A.1 or MPC860 REV A.2 and DRAM
	NO EDO.

	For the MPC821/860ADS REV A board with EDO DRAM the macro EDO_DRAM
	located in config.h should be changed from #undef to #define. 
	The EDO DRAM hangs the CPU when the caches are turned on.
	Consequently the instruction  and data cache are turned off when
	the EDO DRAM is selected.  The EDO DRAM is not supported by 
	the MPC821/860ADS REV PILOT or ENG boards. 

	The MPC821/860ADS REV PILOT or ENG boards are detected dynamically
	and VxWorks performs the initialization according the board revision.

	With the MPC821/860 REV 0.2 or 0.3 CPUs, caches and MMUs should be
	disabled; otherwise, VxWorks hangs the board.

	The UPM (User Programmable Machine) is initialized according the
	SPLL frequency, the DRAM speed (60 or 70 ns), and whether EDO
	capability is supported or not. The UPM is initialized once by
	the romInit() function located in romInit.s.
	Two sets of UPM initialization tables are provided: one for a
	SPLL frequency of 25MHz and one for 50MHz. Select the 25MHz set
	only when the SPLL frequency is 25MHz. If the SPLL
	frequency is different from 25MHz (for example, 24 MHz), VxWorks 
	is not reliable when cache is enabled.  For all other frequencies,
	select the UPM table for 50MHz.  Performance is optimized only
	for 50MHz, but VxWorks is reliable.

RELEASE 1.1/0  Beta, Jun 1996,  (ADS860_1_1_0)

	This release is the first release of the ads860 BSP against
	Tornado 1.0 PPC (Beta). The same BSP is used by the PowerPC 821
	and PowerPC 860. 
	

        CAVEATS:

        1) Due to different silicon bugs the data and instruction cache is
	   turned off.
