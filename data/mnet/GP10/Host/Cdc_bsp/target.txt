NAME
     Motorola MPC821/860ADS & MPC8xxFADS


INTRODUCTION
     This note provides	board-specific information  necessary  to
     run  VxWorks.  Before running VxWorks, verify that	the board
     runs in the factory configuration.	 The ads860 BSP	 produces
     a	VxWorks	 image	running	either on the PowerPC 8xx proces-
     sors. From	the  VxWorks  perspective  these  processors  are
     equivalent.


BOOT ROMS
     No	VxWorks	Boot ROM  is  provided	with  this  BSP	 release.
     Nevertheless VxWorks boot code is working if downloaded into
     the SIMM Flash ROM.

     To	program	the SIMM Flash ROM, the	ADI card from Motorola is
     required.	 This debug card is available for Sun workstation
     or	PC. Connect this ADI card to the MPC821/860ADS board  via
     the  ADI port. Check that a 12V potential is provided to the
     MPC8xx(F)ADS board; otherwise the SIMM  Flash  will  not  be
     erased  and/or re-programmed. On the host,	start the mpc8bug
     executable	(mpc8bug.exe on	PC).  Once  the	 prompt	 appears,
     reset the board with the following	command:

	  821Bug> reset:h


     Then download the bootrom_uncmp.hex file to the Flash:

	  821Bug>					    loadf
     /<PATH_TO_THE_ADS860_BSP>/bootrom_uncmp.hex 100000

     The 100000	value is the address in	 DRAM  memory  where  the
     bootrom_uncmp.hex	file  is temporarily downloaded	before it
     is	moved to Flash.	A message like the following copy  should
     appear:


	  loadf: Loading Srecords file . . .
	  Loading flash	mapped sections	to ram memory buffer:
	  Loading block	: at 00100000
		     : 0004efd0	bytes loaded
	  Programming flash : 0004efd0 bytes  at 02800100-0284f0cf
	  Flash	programming completed

	  Loading ram mapped sections to ram memory:
	  Entry	point (IP) is not set
	  Heap start address set to 0284f0d0
	  821Bug>

     Now the SIMM Flash	memory is programmed with  the	new  boot
     program. To execute this new boot program turn the	board off
     and on. If	the board is still connected to	the ADI	card then
     the  processor  is	 stopped at the	first instruction to exe-
     cute. From	the mpc8bug  prompt  call  the	"go"  command  to
     resume FLASH code execution.

     This board	doesn't	have non-volatile RAM; thus boot  parame-
     ters are not preserved when the system is powered off.

     To	load  VxWorks,	and  for  more	information,  follow  the
     instructions in the "Getting Started" chapter of the VxWorks
     Programmer's Guide.


     An	alternative way	to load	vxWorks	is through the ADI  debug
     card.  Plug  the ADI connector in the ADI port of the board,
     power on the board	and start the mpc8bug executable  on  the
     host. Execute the reset command to	initialize the board:


	  821Bug> reset:h


     Then download VxWorks:


	  821Bug> load /<ADS860_BSP_PATH>/vxWorks
	  Loading ELF file . . .
	  Entry	point set to 00100000
	  Loading section 1 (.text) : 0005fcec bytes at	00100000
	  Loading section 2 (.rodata) :	0000263c bytes at 0015fcec
	  Loading section 4 (.data) : 00001058 bytes at	00162328
	  Loading section 5 (.got) : 00000010 bytes at 00163380
	  Loading section 7 (.sbss) : 00000298 bytes at	00163390 (not loaded)
	  Loading section 8 (.bss) : 000079e8 bytes at 00163628	(not loaded)
	  Heap start address set to 0016b010
	  Loaded 000008da symbols into the symbol table
	  Duplicated symbols (-103) expanded with enumerated suffixes
	  r3 and r5 are	set to 0


     Then reset	the DER	register


	  821Bug> rms DER 0


     And finally start VxWorks execution:


	  821Bug> go 100000

     On	some ADI configurations, resuming execution with the "go"
     could result in exceptions	or other problems. In such cases,
     unplug the	ADI connector, and  reset  the	target	board  to
     start VxWorks.

DEVICES
     The chip drivers included are:
	 ppc860Timer.c	 - Timer library for PPC decrementer, CPM
     timers 2,3,4
	 ppc860Sio.c	 - Serial Communications library for  SMC
     UART
	 ppc860Intr.c	 -  Programmable   Interrupt   Controller
     Library
	 if_cpm.c   - Ethernet Communication library for SCC

     The timer driver, ppc860Timer,  implements	 a  system  clock
     using  the	 PPC  decrementer timer, an auxiliary clock using
     CPM timer 2, and a	32-bit timestamp facilty by cascading CPM
     timers  3	&  4.  The BSP uses SMC1 as a UART to implement	a
     console device, while the CPM SCC1	is used	 as  an	 ethernet
     port.


SPECIAL	CONSIDERATIONS
     The DRAM controller setup is only performed by the	boot pro-
     gram. VxWorks doesn't re-initialize the DRAM controller when
     it	is executed.  The DRAM memory  controller  initialization
     code does not recognized either the size of the DRAM plugged
     or	the access time	or the	processor  clock  frequency.  The
     only configuration	supported is a 4 megabytes DRAM	with a 70
     nanosecond	access time and	with  a	 25  megahertz	processor
     clock.  To	 support  a  different configuration the UpmTable
     table located in romInit.s	file of	the ads860  BSP	 must  be
     changed.


     The MPC8xx(F)ADS  boards  do  not	have  a	 unique	 Ethernet
     hardware  address	assigned to each board.	 A unique address
     is	absolutely necessary if	the user wishes	 to  connect  the
     board  to a network.  Thus, the user must provide a suitable
     6 byte Ethernet address for each board used  on  a	 network.
     The  address  is  programmed  by changing the sysCpmEnetAddr
     character array in	the file sysLib.c.  The	first three bytes
     (0x08,  0x00,  0x3e)  are	a  Motorola-specific  prefix that
     should be kept as-is.  The	user must change the  last  three
     bytes  from  0x03,	 0x02,	0x01 to	three unique bytes (i.e.,
     bytes not used by any other Motorola Ethernet connection  on
     your  net).   Check with your system administrator	if you do
     not know this information.	 If  these  bytes  need	 changing
     (they  often will not), a new boot	ROM must be burned, and	a
     new image must be built.

     The MC68160 EEST part is very sensitive to	its  input  power
     voltage  (VDD).   VDD  to	the chip must be between 4.75 and
     5.25; values outside this range may diminish  functionality.
     Therefore,	 the  power  supplied to the target board and the
     chip should be checked carefully.	Note that there	may be	a
     significant voltage drop between the power	supply connectors
     and the chip (the fuses and connectors alone cause	 approxi-
     mately a 0.1 volts	drop).	In order to get	the Ethernet dev-
     ice to work properly the processor	clock (PLL) should be  at
     least  24	megahertz.  Both the boot program and VxWorks set
     the processor clock to  24	 megahertz.  Configurations  with
     processors	 running  at a frequency higher	than 24	megahertz
     or	lower than 20 megahertz	were not tested.
