--	gp10 MIB
--
--	The Gp10 MIB is organized into 3 sub-leafs. The first contains
--	a consolidation of information based on the CMIP/CMISE GSM definitions
--	in the GSM 12.xx specifications. The second leaf contains information
--	from the public H.323 MIB definitions. The third contains configuration
--	parameters and data that is required for the Gp10 to initialize.
--
--	Initially, only the gp10GsmMib and the gp10ConfigMib leafs
--	of the MIB are defined. As the H.323 specifications are formalized
--	the H.323 values will be added. Note: Initialization parameters for
--	the H.323 stack are stored in a leaf under gp10ConfifMib.
--
--
--	The gp10GsmMib is largest and most complex part of the MIB that
--	is currently defined. It is broken into several leafs as follows: 
--
--	1:	btsBasicPackage			Basic Parameters (primarily RM)
--	2:	btsOptionsPackage		More params (wider interest)
--	3:	firstTransceiverPackage		All the per-transceiver parms
--	4:	secondTransceiverPackage	Exact duplicate for 2nd trx.
--	5:	firstRadioCarrierPackage	The radio carrier information.
--	6:	secondRadioCarrierPackage	Exact duplicate for 2nd trx.
--	7:	btsTimerPackage			General timers used.
--	8:	adjacentCellPackage		Adj Cell Handover & Reselection
--	9:	frequencyHoppingPackage		Frequency Hopping params
--	10:	handoverControlPackage		Handover control params
--	11:	powerControlPackage		Power control params
--	12:	cellMeasurmentPackage		Performance measurment data
--	13:	callControlMeasurmentPackatge	More performance data.

btsBasicPackage OBJECT IDENTIFIER
-- 	DESCRIPTION
-- 		"The bts MOC represents the GSM functional element Base
-- 		 Transceiver Station. An instance of this MOC is associated
-- 		 by containment with a particular bssFunction instance and a
-- 		 particular btsSiteManager instance. Multiple instances of
-- 		 this MOC may be contained within a btsSiteManager instance.
-- 		 The attributes within the package btsBasicPackage describe
-- 		 the basic properties of a BTS that are not related to the
-- 		 Common Control Channels.
-- 
-- 		 The attributes bsIdentityCode and cellGlobalIdentity can be
-- 		 modified by the M-SET command only when the administrative
-- 		 state of the bts is locked.
-- 
-- 		 All values of the administrative, operational, and usage
-- 		 states are supported. The availabilityStatus qualifies in
-- 		 more details the operationalState while the controlStatus
-- 		 provides information to support the test management. The
-- 		 M-SET command changing the administrative state shall not
-- 		 change any other attributes.
-- 
-- 		 The administrative states for the BTS have the following
-- 		 meanings: In the shutting down state, no new traffic is
-- 		 allowed through the BTS. In this state, the BTS is barred
-- 		 (message sent to MS) and no incoming handovers are allowed.
-- 		 If all traffic is cleared, the BTS changes to the locked
-- 		 state. In the locked state, all calls through the BTS are
-- 		 disconnected. The BSC should clear all calls with cause set
-- 		 to 'O and M intervention'. No new traffic is possible on the
-- 		 BTS and no incoming handovers are allowed. In the unlocked
-- 		 state, new traffic is allowed through the BTS and incoming
-- 		 handovers are allowed. The locked administrative state stops
-- 		 normal operations of the resource (not, for example,
-- 		 operations for test purposes)."

--	Transceiver Package
--
--	There are several packages of data that need to be duplicated based
--	on the fact that there are 2 radios in the Gp10. Thus, we have
--	consolidated all of the data parameters that have to do with the
--	two transceivers into the following package. This includes the Baseband
--	Transceiver package, the radio carrier package and the channel package.

-- 	DESCRIPTION
-- 		"The basebandTransceiver managed object class represents

-- 		 rate adaptation, channel encoding and decoding, and frame
-- 		 building.
-- 
-- 		 This definition covers what may be described as the baseband
-- 		 aspects of transmission in the GSM and DCS 1800 base station
-- 		 systems. This functionality is related to the radio carrier
-- 		 aspects by means of the relatedRadioCarrier and the channel

-- 
-- 		 The administrative states of the channel object have the
-- 		 following meanings: When a channel is locked it will

-- 		 in the time slot. If the channel is a control channel, all
-- 		 calls in the BTS may be affected. When a channel is unlocked,
-- 		 it is able to accept traffic. When a channel is shutting down,
-- 		 no new traffic is allowed, no inbound handovers are accepted.
-- 		 In this state, clearing of existing traffic results in
-- 		 transition to locked state. The locked administrative state
-- 		 stops normal operations of the resource (not, for example,
-- 		 operations for test purposes)."
