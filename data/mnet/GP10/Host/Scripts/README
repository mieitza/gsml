 The purpose of this email is to remind every one about the new way of
 starting vipercells and the new startup script files.

 Last week it was decided that a common startup script file will be used
 irrespective of booting/loading form network or flash. The name of this
 script file is viperStart. (For cdc boards 8, 9, and 10, it is
 viperStartCdc1; for cdcim boards it is viperStartCdcim.) These files
 reside in the scripts directory. The startup script file loads all the
 required modules, calls  functions to initialize hardware and starts
 DSPs.

 The startup script file is specified in the boot parameter. This field
 when loading from compact flash is /ata/ViperCall/scripts/viperStart.
 While loading from network specify appropriate path. For example,
 /Beta1-load/Beta2_01/scripts. Also remember to set the 'other' field of
 the boot parameter to correct vipercall base. This field for example can
 be /ata/ViperCall or /Beta-load/Beta2_01.

 The startup scripts file that we have been using from Tornado should be
 considered deprecated.

Another reminder for people who want to use some private built module
instead of official builds...  To do this,

1. Copy official viperStart and module_list (preferable from RCS) to your
   private directory.
   For example, I put copies into K:\Beta2-Load\Test-Script\ as
   myStart, my_list

2. In myStart, change one line of
   viperLoadList("Scripts/module_list", getenv("VIPERCALL_BASE"), 1)
    to

   viperLoadList("/Beta2-Load/Test-Script/my_list", getenv("VIPERCALL_BASE"), 0)

3. In my_list, change the module path.
   For example, from
   Bin/l1proxy.out
    to

   #/Beta2-Load/Test-Bin/l1proxy.out

   Notice # sign suppresses appending base directory and uses absolute path
   for the filename.

4. Set boot param for 'other' field to official build directory, e.g.
   /Beta2-Load/Beta2.0.1

5. Put /Beta2-Load/Test-Script/myStart to init script bootParam
    or  run script "< myStart" from the correct pwd.

p.s. This only works with vxWorks version Beta1.0.2 or Beta2.0.2 up.
     Also, module_list lines should end with UNIX EOL. 'vi -b' works.
     So far, I know Tornado, Notepad saved file will give errors.
     You can use wordpad but you have to rename to remove '.txt'.
     If this is too much trouble, we will fix this.
